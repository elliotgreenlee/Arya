# AIs
AI/llms seem to work best on short, broken up tasks, set up in pipelines of refinement. I think that breaking up
these personal assistant tasks into a pipeline will improve the odds of success.

I really like that with llms you can give them a personality very easily as part of the prompt.
This lends itself to assigning personas to different tasks, as well as choosing personas that work for you.

Some concepts for this I can think of are:
* A household staff, each in charge of an aspect of life. Arya is the head of household.
* A group of friends, each knowledgeable about something, that you ask for advice. Arya is your most trusted friend.
* A royal's advisory panel, each a trusted expert, that reports to you. Arya is your right hand.
* A company VP suite, each a vice president of a department. Arya is your secretary.

Personally, a household staff makes the most sense to me. The AI has to do what I say, it's not a real friend, and
we are working on running my actual household. However, the other options could be really fun, and wouldn't take
more work than changing the prompt.

At each part of the pipeline, we can consult with a differently prompted llm to pre-process the raw data we
extract from the APIs and our storage, get our input, or wholly complete a task. The lead AI doesn't need to come up
with your whole exercise training plan, only schedule your planned exercises. The exercise trainer can do that piece.

Here is my list:
